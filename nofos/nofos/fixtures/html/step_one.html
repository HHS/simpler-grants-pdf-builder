<h3 class="c19" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c34">Purpose</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c3">This program&rsquo;s purpose is to develop and implement clinical rotations for physician assistant students in rural areas that are at least three months long and integrate behavioral health with primary care services. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c3">The program addresses the need to train primary care physician assistants in the prevention, identification, diagnosis, treatment, and referral services for behavioral health conditions. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c3">The goal is to increase the number of primary care physician assistants trained to deliver mental and behavioral health services, including medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), who choose to practice in rural areas after graduation. </span></p>

<h3 class="c19"><span class="c34">Background</span></h3>
<p class="c0" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span>The prevalence of serious mental illness and most psychiatric disorders is similar between those living in rural and urban areas.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;However, rural residents receive mental health treatment less frequently and when they do, it is often with providers with less specialized training.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Approximately one-fifth of the U.S. population lives in rural areas and 6.5 million individuals in these areas have a mental illness.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The Centers for Disease Control reports the opioid overdose death rate in rural areas in 2020 was 26.2 per 100,000.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In addition, individuals with mental and behavioral health conditions and Substance Use Disorder (SUD)/opioid use disorder (OUD) have a higher risk of suicide; rural suicide rates increased 46 percent from 2000-2020 in non-metro areas.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Primary care physician assistants are instrumental in identifying and treating mental and behavioral health and SUD. Approximately 30,000 physician assistants practicing in various primary care settings treat patients with concurrent behavioral health conditions daily.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Although physician assistants encounter patients with mental and behavioral health conditions, only two percent of physician assistants currently specialize in psychiatry.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Between 2017 and 2030, the total supply of all psychiatrists is projected to decline.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The physician assistant profession is projected to increase by 31% by 2029 and will continue to graduate approximately 10,000 individuals annually in the United States.</span><sup class="c72"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;With the growing physician assistant workforce, physician shortages, and increasing need for mental and behavioral health services and SUD/OUD treatment, the PCTE-PARM program supports efforts for educating physician assistant students and provides clinical experiences to improve practice competence and retention in these rural areas. </span></p>
