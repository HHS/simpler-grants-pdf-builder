Scroll-to-top button macro

This macro adds a floating "scroll to top" button that appears when the user
has scrolled down the page. The button is hidden by default and shows with
a smooth fade-in animation once the user scrolls past 90% of the viewport height.

Usage in base.html (context variable approach):
  In your view, set: context['include_scroll_to_top'] = True
  The macro is automatically included via base.html based on the variable.

Direct usage (for overrides):
  {% include "includes/scroll_to_top_button.html" with use_scroll_to_top=True %}

The button visibility is controlled by JavaScript that tracks the scroll position.
Clicking scrolls smoothly to the top and moves focus to #main-content for a11y.
