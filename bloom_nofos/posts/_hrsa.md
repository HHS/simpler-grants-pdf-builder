## Program Description

### Purpose

This program’s purpose is to develop and implement clinical rotations for physician assistant students in rural areas that are at least three months long and integrate behavioral health with primary care services.

The program addresses the need to train primary care physician assistants in the prevention, identification, diagnosis, treatment, and referral services for behavioral health conditions.

The goal is to increase the number of primary care physician assistants trained to deliver mental and behavioral health services, including medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), who choose to practice in rural areas after graduation.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">For more details, see [Program Requirements and Expectations](#bookmark=id.3rdcrjn)</span>.

### Background

The prevalence of serious mental illness and most psychiatric disorders is similar between those living in rural and urban areas.[^1] However, rural residents receive mental health treatment less frequently and when they do, it is often with providers with less specialized training.[^2] Approximately one-fifth of the U.S. population lives in rural areas and 6.5 million individuals in these areas have a mental illness.[^3] The Centers for Disease Control reports the opioid overdose death rate in rural areas in 2020 was 26.2 per 100,000.[^4] In addition, individuals with mental and behavioral health conditions and Substance Use Disorder (SUD)/opioid use disorder (OUD) have a higher risk of suicide; rural suicide rates increased 46 percent from 2000-2020 in non-metro areas.[^5]

Primary care physician assistants are instrumental in identifying and treating mental and behavioral health and SUD. Approximately 30,000 physician assistants practicing in various primary care settings treat patients with concurrent behavioral health conditions daily.[^6] Although physician assistants encounter patients with mental and behavioral health conditions, only two percent of physician assistants currently specialize in psychiatry.[^7] Between 2017 and 2030, the total supply of all psychiatrists is projected to decline.[^8]

The physician assistant profession is projected to increase by 31% by 2029 and will continue to graduate approximately 10,000 individuals annually in the United States.[^9] With the growing physician assistant workforce, physician shortages, and increasing need for mental and behavioral health services and SUD/OUD treatment, the PCTE-PARM program supports efforts for educating physician assistant students and provides clinical experiences to improve practice competence and retention in these rural areas.

#### Program Definitions

The following definitions apply to the PCTE-PARM Program for Fiscal Year 2024 and the dictionary of key program-related terms in the [Health Workforce Glossary](https://bhw.hrsa.gov/grants/resourcecenter/glossary)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> also provides useful information</span>.

**Integrated behavioral health - **is care in one setting for medical conditions and related behavioral health factors that affect health and well-being. For the purpose of this NOFO, this care is within the rural primary care setting.

**Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD**) – is an approach to opioid use treatment that combines the use of FDA-approved drugs with counseling and behavioral therapies for people diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD).

**Primary care **– for the purpose of this NOFO, includes family medicine, general internal medicine internal, general pediatrics, and combined general internal medicine with general pediatrics.

**Stipend - **is defined as subsistence allowance for students (trainees) to help defray living expenses during the time of their integrated behavioral health clinical rotation training experience and are not provided as a condition of employment. The stipend does not include tuition, fees, health insurance, or other Participant/Trainee Support costs associated with the training program.

**Disadvantaged background: **someone who is any/all of these: environmentally disadvantaged; economically disadvantaged; educationally disadvantaged[^10].

The budget narrative supports the information you provide in the Research and Related Budget Form. See [Standard Forms](#heading=h.3fwokq0). The merit review committee reviews both.

It includes added detail and justifies the costs you ask for. As you develop your budget, consider:

        * If the costs are reasonable and consistent with your project’s purpose and activities.
        * The restrictions on spending funds. See [Funding Limitations](#heading=h.17dp8vu).

To create your budget narrative, see detailed instructions in section 4.1.v of the [Application Guide](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/grants/sf-424-rr-app-guide.pdf#page=33). Below are some additional instructions specific to this NOFO.

#### Stipends

Ensure that your budget breakdown includes the summation of stipends and the projected number of trainees for each budget period. See [Student Stipends](#heading=h.lnxbz9).

#### Preceptor Support Costs

For applicants with preceptor support costs, include these costs in “Other” under Participant Support Costs on SF-424 R&R Budget form.

For applicants with preceptor Participant support costs, in your budget narrative list continuing education training/fees, conferences, travel, other, and the number of preceptors. Ensure that your budget breakdown separates these preceptor costs, and includes a separate sub-total entitled “Total Preceptor Support Costs” which includes the summation of all preceptor costs. Preceptor Participant Support Costs are only allowable for preceptors (who are not employees of the applicant organization) who train PA students at rural clinical sites.

#### Consultant Services

Identify each consultant, the services they will perform, the total number of days, travel costs, and the total estimated costs.

#### Subaward Budgets

You will also include subaward budgets using the Subaward Budget Attachment(s) form.

Upload a detailed line-item budget form for each subaward to the Subaward Budget Attachment(s) Form. NOTE: The R&R Subaward Budget Attachment Form limits the number of attachments for subawards to 10. If you need to include additional line-item budget forms, upload the attachment in R&R Other Project Information Form, block 12 “Other Attachments.” These additional line-item budget forms for subawards will not count against the page limit.

### Risk Review

Before making an award, we review the risk that you will not prudently manage federal funds. We need to make sure you've handled any past federal awards well and demonstrated sound business practices. We:

        * Review any past performance
        * Analyze the cost of the budget
        * Assess your management systems
        * Ensure you continue to be eligible
        * Make sure you comply with any public policies.

We may ask you to submit additional information.

As part of this review, we use SAM.gov Entity Information [Responsibility / Qualification](https://sam.gov/content/entity-information) to check your history for all awards likely to be over $250,000. You can comment on your organization's information in SAM.gov. We'll consider your comments before making a decision about your level of risk.

If we find a significant risk, we may choose not to fund your application or to place specific conditions on the award.

For more details, see [45 CFR 75.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-75.205).

### Selection Process

When making funding decisions, we consider:

        * Merit review results. These are key in making decisions but are not the only factor.
        * The amount of available funds.
        * Assessed risk.
        * Pre-award activities, as described in Section V.3 of this NOFO
        * Funding Preference for Medically Underserved Community (MUC)
        * The funding priorities, funding preferences, and special considerations listed below.

We may:

        * Fund out of rank order.
        * Fund applications in whole or in part.
        * Fund applications at a lower amount than requested.
        * Decide not to allow a prime recipient to subaward if they may not be able to monitor and manage subrecipients properly.
        * Choose to fund no applications under this NOFO.

#### Funding Preference

This program provides a funding preference for some applicants, as authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 295j (Section 791 of the Public Health Service Act). Section 791 of the Public Health Service Act requires a funding preference for any qualified application ranked at or above the 20th percentile of proposals that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group.

You must clearly indicate the basis for which you are requesting the funding preference in the Project Abstract and provide supporting documentation in\*\* \*\*[Attachment 5](#heading=h.41mghml).

If your application receives a funding preference, we will place it in a more competitive position among fundable applications. If your application does not receive a funding preference, it will receive full and equitable consideration during the review process. The HRSA staff will determine the funding factor and will apply it to any qualified applicant that demonstrates they meet the criteria for the preferences as follows:

##### Preference: Medically Underserved Community (MUC)

This funding preference focuses on the number of program completers from your residency training program that are employed in MUCs. To apply, you must provide and clearly label in Attachment 5\*\* \*\*that you are requesting consideration for the MUC Funding Preference.

You must provide all the requested data shown below and you must include a description of how you determined the physician assistant graduate practices in an MUC.

For this NOFO, a MUC is defined as a geographic location or population of people eligible for designation by the federal government as one of these:

        * Health Professional Shortage Area
        * Medically Underserved Area
        * Medically Underserved Population
        * Governor’s Certified Shortage Area for Rural Health Clinic purposes

Use the following link to determine whether the physician assistant graduate is practicing in a medically underserved community, see [Health Workforce Data, Tools, and Dashboards](https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/health-workforce-shortage-areas) on our website.

**Qualification 1: High MUC Placement Rate**

You can request funding preference if you have a high rate for placing physician assistant graduates in practice settings that have the principal focus of serving MUCs.

To qualify for High MUC Placement Rate, an applicant must demonstrate that the percentage of graduates placed in practice settings serving MUC for Academic Year (AY) 2021-2022 and AY 2022-2023 is greater than or equal to fifty (50) percent of all graduates.

High Rate= # of Graduates in AY 21-22 Employed in MUCs

                                                            Plus

                       # of Graduates in AY 22-23 Employed in MUCs

**Qualification 3: Mechanism for New Training Programs to Qualify for the Funding Preference **

Qualification 3 serves as a pathway for new programs. New programs that meet at least four of the criteria described under Qualification 3 below shall qualify for a funding preference under this section.

If you wish to request funding preference under Qualification 3 submit documentation in Attachment 5\*\* \*\*that you have graduated/completed less than three (3) classes and meet at least four (4) of the seven (7) criteria.

        * The applicant organization’s mission statement identifies a specific purpose of the program as being the preparation of health professionals to serve underserved populations.
        * The curriculum of the program includes content which will help to prepare     practitioners to serve underserved populations.
        * Substantial clinical training in MUCs is required under the program.
        * A minimum of 20 percent of the clinical faculty of the program spend at least 50 percent of their time providing or supervising care in MUCs.
        * The entire program or a substantial portion of the program is physically located in a MUC.
        * Trainee assistance, which is linked to service in MUCs following graduation, is available to trainees through the program.
        * The program provides a placement mechanism for helping graduates find positions in MUCs.

To apply for the MUC Preference as a new program, submit a brief narrative entitled “New Program MUC Preference Request” in Attachment 5\*\* \*\*that will:

        * Describe how your program meets at least four of the seven criteria mentioned above.
        * State the year the program was established, as described above.
        * Provide the total number of graduates for each year, including the current year, since the training program began.

**NOTE:**  New “training tracks” within existing programs DO NOT qualify for the MUC Preference as a New Training Program. Programs that have been significantly changed or improved with a new focus also DO NOT qualify for MUC Preference as a New Training Program.

A total of one funding preference will be granted to any qualified applicant that provides the required data that demonstrates that they meet the criteria for the preference via one of the following qualifications. You can provide data for more than one qualification, but you will only be awarded one funding preference.
