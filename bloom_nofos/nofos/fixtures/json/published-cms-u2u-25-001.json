          "body": "We know it can be challenging for states to fund the work necessary to improve the Essential Health Benefits (EHB). Improving EHB typically involves:\n\n* Comprehensively reviewing EHB-benchmark plans.\n* Seeking public feedback on the coverage of EHB in the state.\n* Submitting an application to CMS to change the EHB in the state.\n\nWe understand that, due in part to these challenges, that there are many states that have not considered updating their EHB-benchmark plans. These states include 24 of the 28 states expected to have a Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) as of January 1, 2026. \n\nAs a result, the covered benefits in the Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through the Exchanges in these states may not reflect recent changes in medical evidence, scientific advancement, and clinical care guidelines. Additionally, people enrolled in these QHPs may have trouble accessing EHB because of cost, claims denials, utilization management, discriminatory benefit design, or other factors.\n\nWe want to lessen these challenges through the EHB-Benchmark Plan Modernization Grant for States with a Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE EHB Mod Grant). This new grant program will fund states with an FFE for a variety of activities related to the review of EHB-benchmark plans. The goal is to help applicants modernize and change their EHB-benchmark plans under [45 CFR 156.111.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-156.111) \n\n"

[Section 1302(b) of the ACA r](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590)equires the Secretary of HHS to define the EHB and make sure that the EHB:\n\n* Includes at least the following general categories and the items and services covered within the categories:\n\t+ Ambulatory patient services.\n\t+ Emergency services.\n\t+ Hospitalization.\n\t+ Maternity and newborn care.\n\t+ Mental health and substance use disorder services.\n\t+ Including behavioral health treatment.\n\t+ Prescription drugs.\n\t+ Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices.\n\t+ Laboratory services.\n\t+ Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management.\n\t+ Pediatric services, including oral and vision care.\n* Is equal in scope to the benefits provided under a typical employer plan.\n* Reflect an appropriate balance among the categories, so that benefits are not unduly weighted toward any category.\n* Does not make coverage decisions, determine reimbursement rates, establish incentive programs, or design benefits in ways that discriminate against individuals because of their age, disability, or expected length of life.\n* Takes into account the health care needs of diverse populations, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and other groups.\n* Makes sure that individuals are not denied essential health benefits on the basis of their age, expected length of life, present or predicted disability, degree of medical dependency, or quality of life.\n* Is periodically reviewed and updated to address any gaps in access to coverage, changes in medical evidence, or scientific advancement.\n\nCMS defined the EHB using a benchmark-based approach in the February 25, 2013 [**Federal Register** (78 FR 12834) (EHB Rule)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/FR-2013-02-25/2013-04084#:~:text=related%20to%20accreditation.-,Summary,as%20the%20Affordable%20Care%20Act.). Under this approach, a health plan provides the EHB if it provides, among other things:\n\n* Benefits that are substantially equal to the EHB-benchmark plan including covered benefits.\n* Limitations on coverage (including coverage of benefit amount, duration, and scope) that are substantially equal to the EHB-benchmark plan.\n* Prescription drug benefits that meet the requirements of [45 CFR 156.122](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-156.122).\n\nThus, a state\u2019s EHB-benchmark plan serves as a reference plan for benefits defined as EHB in the state. \n\nStates play an integral role in determining what benefits are included in EHB-benchmark plans. For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, states select or change an EHB-benchmark plan by meeting the requirements at [45 CFR 156.111](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-156.111), which include certain actuarial analysis and confirmations that the state\u2019s selected EHB-benchmark plan meets the scope of benefits requirements at \u00a7 156.111(b)(2). \n\nCMS recently revised the requirements at [\u00a7 156.111](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-156.111) in the April 15, 2024 [**Federal Register** (89 FR 26218) (2025 Payment Notice)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/15/2024-07274/patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-hhs-notice-of-benefit-and-payment-parameters-for-2025), to make this process easier to understand and to undertake, with the ultimate goal of promoting more frequent EHB-benchmark plan changes to expand coverage. Twelve states, including only four states with an FFE (Alaska, Michigan, North Dakota, and South Dakota), have used [156.111](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-156.111) to add or expand coverage for certain benefits to EHB-benchmark plans since 2020.<sup><a href=\"#endnote-6\" id=\"endnote-ref-6\">[3]</a></sup>\n\n"

You may engage contractors such as actuarial, health policy, or clinical firms to help with all or some of these activities, under your guidance and direction. \n\nYou must do all of the following:\n\n1. Undertake a comprehensive review of the state\u2019s current EHB-benchmark plan and consider potential changes based on your review. At a minimum, you must:\n2. Identify whether enrollees are having trouble accessing the benefits in the state\u2019s EHB-benchmark plan for reasons of cost, claims denials, utilization management, discriminatory benefit design, or other factors. You may fulfill this analysis through statistically valid consumer surveys, engaging in outreach with interested parties such as consumer groups, and reviewing data on issuer claim denials, utilization management, or consumer complaints related to consumers enrolled in the FFE.\n3. Ensure health equity. To ensure that EHB-benchmark plans are designed to further health equity<sup><a href=\"#endnote-8\" id=\"endnote-ref-8\">[4]</a></sup> initiatives and address health care disparities, your analysis must address how the state\u2019s EHB-benchmark plan could be updated to better meet the needs of people:\n* With lower incomes.\n* Of all ages, including children and older adults.\n* With disabilities or who have a greater risk of developing serious health issues.\n* Of color.\n* Who identify as LGBTQIA+.\n* In rural communities.\n* Who have limited English proficiency.\n* Who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.\n1. Identify areas where the state\u2019s EHB-benchmark plan could be updated to account for changes in medical evidence, scientific advancement, and clinical care guidelines. This may involve consulting or contracting with one or more clinical experts to analyze the state\u2019s EHB-benchmark plan,\n\nFor example, states could do one or more of the following: \n\n* Consider whether benefit visit and other limits are clinically based and meet the needs of a diverse population, or whether they are arbitrary.\n* Look at current EHB-benchmark coverage for particular conditions or scenarios, such as HIV, diabetes, infertility, chronic kidney disease, or developmental disabilities, and compare that coverage to generally accepted clinical guidelines.\n* Examine whether coverage prevents access to medical advancements such as new radiology and laboratory methods, cost-effective yet newer advancements such as silver diamine fluoride, or newer treatment modalities such as doula care and peer recovery support services.\n1. Identify areas where the state\u2019s EHB-benchmark plan could be updated to account for national and/or state healthcare concerns.\n\t* You must examine your EHB-benchmark plan for how it may account for nationwide health care concerns (such as the opioid epidemic or addressing mental health concerns).\n\t* You must also examine your EHB-benchmark plan for how it accounts for concerns that may be specific to the state (such as diabetes, obesity, or maternal health outcomes).\n\t* You must identify at least five areas where your EHB-benchmark plan may need to be modified or updated to account for a national healthcare concern, a state healthcare concern, or both.\n2. Perform a regional comparison analysis. You must assess how the state\u2019s EHB-benchmark plan\u2019s benefits compare to at least three other state EHB-benchmark plans in a nearby geographic region. This assessment must include whether there are differences in the scope of EHB (such as maternity and newborn care), benefits not covered as EHB for which there is a public health need or expectation of coverage (such as durable medical equipment), or other deficiencies.\n3. Ensure the state\u2019s EHB-benchmark plan is clear and unambiguous. You must perform a comprehensive review of its EHB-benchmark plan to determine whether it is sufficiently clear which benefits are covered and the scope of benefits. If the plan is ambiguous in any way, you must consider how to make it clearer.\n4. **Submit a Section 508-compliant report to CMS for publication and publish the same report on a public state website.** The report must reflect the findings of your comprehensive review of your current EHB-benchmark plan, as described in the previous requirements.\n5. For applicants that decide to submit pursuant to the process at 156.111(b)(2)(ii) before the end of the period of performance: Submit such an application to CMS by May 6, 2026, for effectiveness in plan year 2028, or by May 5, 2027, for effectiveness in plan year 2029. We encourage you to submit an application to update your EHB-benchmark plan after the end of the award period, but the grant will not be extended to provide you with support. We urge you to apply to update your EHB-benchmark plans as a result of completing the requirements of this grant, but this application is not required. States that decide to submit an EHB-benchmark plan submission before the end of the period of performance may use grant funds to conduct the required actuarial analysis to demonstrate that the state\u2019s new EHB-benchmark plan complies with the typicality regulatory requirements at 156.111(b)(2).<sup><a href=\"#endnote-11\" id=\"endnote-ref-11\">[5]</a></sup> You do not have to include your EHB-benchmark plan application in the report described in program requirement #2.\n6. For applicants that decide to seek additional grant funds for an advisory board to advise the state: Applicants that create advisory boards may not require the advisory board to be responsible for completing other program requirements. At a minimum, a state\u2019s advisory board must:\n7. Include patients and patient representatives on the advisory board.\n8. Ensure the participation or perspective of persons:\n\t* With lower incomes.\n\t* Of all ages, including children and older adults.\n\t* With disabilities or who have a greater risk of developing serious health issues.\n\t* Of color.\n\t* Who identify as LGBTQIA+.\n\t* In rural communities.\n\t* Who have limited English proficiency.\n\t* Who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.\n* Be subject to a public notice and comment process to address updates and full public transparency on advisory board proceedings and materials.\n1.
